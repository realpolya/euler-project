Counting Fractions

Consider the fraction,  n / d, where n and d are positive integers.
If n < d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced 
proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in 
ascending order of size, we get:

1 / 8, 1 / 7, 1 / 6, 1 / 5, 1 / 4, 2 / 7, 
1 / 3, 3 / 8, 2 / 5, 3 / 7, 1 / 2, 4 / 7, 
3 / 5, 5 / 8, 2 / 3, 5 / 7, 3 / 4, 4 / 5, 
5 / 6, 6 / 7, 7 / 8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.
How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper 
fractions for d <= 1,000,000?
