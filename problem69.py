Totient Maximum

Euler's totient function, phi(n) [sometimes called the phi function], 
is defined as the number of positive integers not exceeding n which 
are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, 
are all less than or equal to nine and relatively prime to nine, 
phi(9)=6.

It can be seen that n = 6 produces a maximum n/phi(n) for n <= 10.
Find the value of n <= 1,000,000 for which n/phi(n) is a maximum.
